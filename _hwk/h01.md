<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

Please read Chapter 1 in Perkovic.  Then complete these problems.

<ol>

{% include hwk_li_name_10pts.html %}

<li>Section 1.1 describes Computer Science in general.  It includes
a passage that distinguishes between models, algorithms and programs.

I'm going to ask two questions about the relationships among these concepts.
In your answer, don't just copy down an exact quote from the textbook;
explain in your own words.  If you don't think you understand the relationship,
be honest about that, and write down what you are confused about, or your best guess at what the author is trying to say.


<ol>
<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(5 pts) What is the relationship between a <em>model</em> and an
<em>algorithm</em>?
</li>
<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(5 pts) What is the relationship between an <em>algorithm</em> and a <em>program</em>?
</li>
</ol>


</li>


<li><p>(10 pts) Section 1.2 describes Computer Systems in general.

According to our author, why did computer scientists create programming languages such as Python, C, C++, Java, etc.? </p>

<div class="pagebreak">
</div>

</li>

<li>Continuing with questions from Section 1.2:

<ol>

<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(10 pts) The author makes a distinction between the "core set" of features in a programming language, and those
that are put into "software libraries".   What are two examples of features that end up in libraries rather than in the
core language?</li>


<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(10 pts) What is the advantage of putting those features into libraries rather than into the core?</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(10 pts) APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are important in programming&mdash;our author gives a nice clear explanation of what an API is.   What is that explanation?</li>

</ol>


</li>


<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">Section 1.3 describes the Python programming language.

<ol>
<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(10 pts) What is the interactive shell used for?
</li>
<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(10 pts) What does a Python program consist of?
</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5em;"><p>Section 1.4 contains a description of a sample problem that the author uses to illustrate "computational thinking".  The author notes that in applying computational thinking to a problem, one of the steps we take is to decide which
details of the problem are important, and which are not.
</p>

<ol> 
<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(10 pts) Give two examples of details about the problem statement that, according to the author's discussion, are not relevant, and should be ignored.
</li>
<li style="padding-bottom:5em;">(10 pts) Give two examples of details that are definitely relevant, and that we need to pay attention to in coming up with a solution.
</li>
</ol>

Section 2.1 describes how several operators and built in functions in
Python work.  What would be the result of entering the following at
the Python interactive shell prompt?

(Note: You are encouraged to check your answers at the Python prompt
before turning in your work, but try this on paper first, just by
reading the text and trying to predict what will happen.  Then try
typing in the results at the Python prompt.  Change your answers if
they were mistaken, but even more important, try to figure out why you
were incorrect.)

Be very precise.  Note that `True` is not the same in Python as `true`; upper
vs. lower case matters.  You will not get full credit for answers that are not
precisely correct.

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) As described in section 2.1, a Python assignment statement contains the assignment operator, an expression and a variable, but not in that order.

What is the correct order for these three parts, reading from left to right?

</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) Section 2.1 contains a list of thirty-three <em>reserved words</em> in Python that may not be used as the name of a variable.   You don't need to memorize this list, but you do need to know where to find it, either in the book, or online.  So, to be sure you can find it, list all of the Python reserved words that start with the letter `c` or `f`.
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">
Section 2.2 describes strings in Python, including the concepts of "dictionary order" (also called "lexicographic order"), concatenation of strings, multiplication of strings times an integer, the `in` operator, the `not in` operation, the `len` function, and string indexing.  Review that material.

Then, assuming the following assignment statements have been entered at the Python prompt:

```python
school = "UCSB"
course = "CS8"
qtr = "M17"
```

Indicate the value of each of these expressions:

div.evenbigger table * th { padding: 0em 1pt 0em 1pt; margin: 0 0 0 0;

Section 2.3 describes lists and tuples in Python.  Assuming the following assignment statements have been entered at the Python prompt:

```python
schools = ("UCSB","Stanford","UCLA","UCSD","Cal Tech")
schedules = [ ["CMPSC 8","MATH 3A"], ["CMPSC 8","PSTAT 5A"],["MATH 3B"] ]
units = [8, 8, 4]
```

What would be the result of entering the following at
the Python interactive shell prompt?

(Note: You are encouraged to check your answers at the Python prompt
before turning in your work, but try this on paper first, just by
reading the text and trying to predict what will happen.  Then try
typing in the results at the Python prompt.  Change your answers if
they were mistaken, but even more important, try to figure out why you
were incorrect.)

Be very precise.  Note that `True` is not the same in Python as `true`; upper
vs. lower case matters.  You will not get full credit for answers that are not
precisely correct.  And note that `"UCSB"` and `["UCSB"]` are not the same in Python&mdash;one is a string, and the other is a list of length one containing a single string.

<li style="margin-bottom:10em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) As described in section 2.3, lists and tuples are similar, but there are two big differences.  One is that lists are written with square brackets `[]` while tuples are written with parentheses `()`.  What is the other big difference between lists and tuples?


</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) Write a line of Python code that assigns the variable `mySchool` to have a value that is a tuple of length 1, containing the single string `"UCSB"`.


</li>



<li markdown="1"> Assume that the following sequence of statements has been
entered at the Python prompt.  Note that subsequent statements may
change the value of the variables (e.g. `colors` is altered by the
call to the `append` method)

```python
colors = ["red","red","green"]
colors.append("blue")
colors.reverse()
```

<style>
div.evenbigger table * td { padding: 2em 1pt 2em 1pt; text-align: center; }
