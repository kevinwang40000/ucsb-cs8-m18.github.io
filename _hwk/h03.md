<li markdown="1"> One important
abstraction provided by most operating systems (Windows, Linux, or
MacOS, for example) is something called a "file system".

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts)
As was discussed in Chapter 1, one of the
purposes of an abstraction is to provide a uniform way of treating
something that hides irrelevant detail.  Our text points out an important
detail of storing information that a file system helps us to ignore.  What is that detail?
</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) According to our
text, every file on a file system can be referred to be an "absolute
pathname", which consists of a sequence of ... what?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) In contrast to an "absolute pathname", we have the concept of a "relative pathname".   What is the technical term used for the "starting point" of a "relative pathname"?

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1"> Pages 112-114 discuss four ways of reading text from a file.

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">(10 pts) The first way is shown in the listing at the bottom of p. 112.  On line 4 of that
listing we see:

```
   content = infile.read()
```

After this line of code is executed, what would `type(content)` return?  (i.e. would it be `<class 'int'>`, `<class 'float'>`, `<class 'str'>`, `<class 'list'>`, or something else?)

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) The second way is shown in the middle of p. 113.  On line 7 of that
listing we see:

```
   wordList = content.split()
```

What does the `.split` method do, and what is stored in `wordList` as a result?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) The third way is shown in the listing near the top of p. 114.  On line 4 of that
listing we see:

```
   lineList = infile.readlines()
```

After this line of code is executed, what would `type(lineList)` return? (i.e. would it be `<class 'int'>`, `<class 'float'>`, `<class 'str'>`, `<class 'list'>`, or something else?)

</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) The fourth and final way is shown in an interactive example on the lower half of p. 114, and looks like this (with the Python prompts removed):


```
infile = open('example.txt')
for line in infile:
   print(line,end='')
```

The book suggests that this fourth method has an advantage over the other three in a particular circumstance.  What is the circumstance in which we would want to use this method instead of one of the other three?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Section 4.4 discusses two types of problems that can arise in a Python program: <em>errors</em> and <em>exceptions</em>.    One difference is that in Python an <em>error</em> just results in a message bring printed on the screen, while an <em>exception</em> also results in an object being created that stores information about the exception.   Another difference is the root cause, or context in which errors happen vs. exceptions.  Describe the difference between what kind of problem causes an <em>error</em>, vs what kind of problem causes an <em>exception</em>.

Please read {{page.desc2}}.  Then complete these problems.



<li style="margin-bottom:0em;" markdown="1"> (40 pts) p. 129 shows a function definition for a multi-way if/else that
prints a message depending on the temperature.

Rewrite this function so that instead of printing a message, it returns a letter grade (e.g. `return 'A'` instead of `print('It is hot')` based on the integer parameter.  If the grade is 90 or above, return an 'A'.  If it is 60 or higher, but less than 90, return a 'C', and if it is less than 60, return an 'F'.  (In real life, there would be Bs and Ds, but this is just an
exercise.)

<b>NOTE:</b> Be careful about the fact that in an `if`/`elif`/`else`, some of the relationships are implicit.  You cannot get to the `elif` unless the condition on the first `if` is false.  So you should not check for that a second time.     (To be more clear: the `elif` on p. 129 says: `elif t > 32:` rather than `if t <= 86 and t > 32`.    The `t<=86` part is unnecessary, because we would never even get to the `elif` unless `t<=86` were true.  Make sure you keep this in mind as you write your code for this problem.   Points may be deducted if you do redundant checks, even if the code "works".)

<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) p. 134-136 discusses the "Accumulator Pattern", which is a very important topic in this course; one of the most important for you to master.  So please read those two pages several times and try to understand every detail.    The figure at the top of p. 135 shows the various stages of execution for the code on p. 134.

The code `mySum = mySum + num` takes the old value of `mySum`, adds `num` to it, and stores the result back in `mySum`.

That code is done inside a `for` loop, `for num in myList`, after setting `mySum` initially to zero.

The final value for `mySum` is `20`.  What does that number `20` represent in this case?
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) On p. 135, we see the intermediate values for mySum, namely `3`, `5`, `12,` `11,` and `10`.   Try to understand where those values come from as the loop progresses.

Then, imagine the same loop were executed, but with the first line of code being `numList=[9, 3, 1, 1, 7]`  
(instead of `numList=[3, 2, 7, -1, 9]`.)   What would the successive intermediate values of `mySum` be in that case?  List them in the space below.

<li style="margin-bottom:6em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) On page 135-136, the textbook discusses accumulating a product instead of a sum.   The accumulator variable is called `myProd` this time.  In the version of the code that works properly, what is `myProd` initialized to, and why?

<li markdown="1"> (10 pts) Section 5.3 describes how a "list of lists" can be used to represent a 2-dimensional list, such as a matrix or grid.

Suppose we wanted to program a Python program to play Tic-Tac-Toe.   Tic-Tac-Toe is played in a grid similar to the ones shown in the figures below.  Figure (a) shows an empty Tic-Tac-Toe grid, while Figures (b),(c),(d) show what might be the first three moves of the game.  Players take turns filling in squares with 'x' and 'o'.

We can represent the Tic-Tac-Toe boards shown here as lists of lists of strings.  A list of list of strings representation is shown below for three of the five boards.  The top level list represents a list of three rows.  Each of the lists has three elements, each of which is a space, `x` or `o` for that square.

The tables below shows the representations for the boards in Figures (1),(3) and (5).
Fill in the Python representations for Figures (2) and (4).
